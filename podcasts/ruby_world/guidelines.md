## Do not include
- Always lead with podcast name and author
- Sponsor messages or calls to action
- Recaps of what was just said
- Phrases like "in today's episode" or "stay tuned"
- Episodes supposed to be daily, not weekly. So avoid typical podcast phrases like "In the news this week", "That's it for this week" and similar
