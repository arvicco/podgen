# Podcast Guidelines

- Target length: 10–12 minutes
- Open with a 60-second news brief covering the most interesting recent development
- Two main segments of 4–5 minutes each, one per topic
- Close with a single practical takeaway or thought to sit with

## Tone
Conversational and direct. Speak like a smart, slightly opinionated friend,
not a journalist or content creator. No filler phrases. No forced enthusiasm.

- AI and software development news
- Ruby ecosystem updates
- Anything technically interesting from Hacker News in the past week

## Do not include
- Sponsor messages or calls to action
